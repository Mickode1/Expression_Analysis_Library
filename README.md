# Title

**Differential Gene Expression Analysis: Normal vs. UUO Mouse Models**

## Background

**Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO)** is a commonly used experimental model for studying renal injury. While it effectively models the kidney's response to urinary tract blockage, its applications extend beyond this. UUO is an excellent model for investigating irreversible acute kidney disease and the mechanisms underlying chronic kidney diseases [1]:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11255-013-0520-1#citeas

Therefore, this project explores and uncovers the genes significantly expressed in the UUO mouse model and the associated biological processes. The goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in these disease states and to identify potential therapeutic interventions.

This repository is divided into these sections:

- Project Staging: Details project dependencies, data loading and preparation, quality control, filtering, and normalization steps.
- Analyses: The analyses include differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis.
- Results and Conclusion: The biological implications of the analyses were discussed.

## Data Sources and Analyses
The datasets used in this project were obtained from an experimental study titled [Silencing SMOC2 ameliorates kidney fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation]:https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/90299. The datasets are publicly available through the accession number [GSE85209]:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/?term=GSE85209.




Exploring the **molecular mechanisms** of diseases and **identifying key genes** involved in their progression to advance our understanding and development of targeted therapies.
