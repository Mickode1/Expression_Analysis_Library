# Title

**Differential Gene Expression Analysis: Normal vs. UUO Mouse Models**

## Background

**Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO)** is a commonly used experimental model for studying renal injury. While it effectively models the kidney's response to urinary tract blockage, its applications extend beyond this. UUO is an excellent model for investigating irreversible acute kidney disease and the mechanisms underlying chronic kidney diseases [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11255-013-0520-1#citeas)

Therefore, this project explores and uncovers the genes significantly expressed in the UUO mouse model and the associated biological processes. The goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in these disease states and to identify potential therapeutic interventions.

This repository is divided into these sections:

- Project Staging: Details project dependencies, data loading and preparation, quality control, filtering, and normalization steps.
- Analysis: The analysis includes differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis.
- Results and Conclusion: The biological implications of the analyses were discussed.

## Data Sources and Analyses
The datasets used in this project were obtained from an experimental study titled [Silencing SMOC2 ameliorates kidney fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation](https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/90299). The datasets are publicly available under the accession number [GSE85209](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/?term=GSE85209). The sequencing data for the cell lines can be accessed through the following accession numbers: GSM2260466 GSM2260467 GSM2260468 GSM2260469 GSM2260470 GSM2260471 GSM2260472
